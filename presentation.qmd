## The Big Question

+ How does hostility towards unhoused people function spatially in the city of Portland? 
  - Where are people most vulnerable? 
  - How can we use statistical methods to better allocate public infrastructure in the city?


## The Data
  
+ Impact Reduction Program (IRP) via the One Point of Contact Campsite Reporting System
  - Citizens make reports
  - Removals are posted by the IRP, upon their assessments
  
+ Census Data
  - Median Income 
  - Total Population
  
## Limitations

+ We only get points for where people are reported
+ A single point can refer to over 30 people at a given site
  - Bigger targets for displacement

```{r}
camp %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>%
  glimpse()
```

## Implications 

+ It appears like lower income neighborhoods typically have higher removal rates 
  - Businesses?
  - Police activity? 
  - Camp sizes?
  
## Looking Ahead

+ I plan to fit a linear model exploring the relationship between removal rate and median income. Hopefully this will shed more light on the situation.
+ I also plan to create a map of the public resources in the city on top of the median income map to get a sense for who has the best access to public infrastructure. 
+ For future analysis, it would be helpful to incorporate data that represents the size of campsites.
