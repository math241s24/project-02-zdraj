## The Big Question

+ How does hostility function spatially in the city of Portland? How can we use statistical methods to better allocate infrastructure in the city?


## The Data
  
+ Impact Reduction Program (IRP) via the One Point of Contact Campsite Reporting System
+ Citizens make reports
+ Removals are posted by the IRP, upon their assessments
  
## The Data

```{r}
camp %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>%
  glimpse()
```

## Implications 

+ It appears like lower income neighborhoods typically have higher removal rates 
+ I plan to fit a linear model exploring the relationship between removal rate and median income. Hopefully this will shed more light on the situation.
+ For future analysis, it would be helpful to incorporate data that represents the sizes of campsites.
